# Titanic-Survival-Prediction 🚢🔍

📖 Overview

This project, completed as part of my Codsoft internship, focuses on predicting the survival chances of passengers on the Titanic. By analyzing historical passenger data, the goal is to develop a machine learning model to classify passengers as survivors or non-survivors based on their features such as age, gender, and class.

🚀 Features
* Analyze and preprocess Titanic passenger data.
* Explore relationships between passenger features and survival rates.
* Build and evaluate a classification model for survival prediction.
* Gain insights into the factors influencing survival on the Titanic.

🛠️ Technologies Used
* Python: Programming language.
* Pandas & NumPy: Data manipulation and analysis.
* Matplotlib & Seaborn: Data visualization.
* Scikit-learn: Machine learning model development.
  
🧠 Steps Involved
* Data Analysis: Explore and visualize the dataset to uncover trends and insights.
* Feature Engineering: Handle missing values and preprocess data for modeling.
* Model Building: Use classification algorithms to predict survival.
* Evaluation: Assess model performance using accuracy, precision, and recall.
  
🌟 Key Learnings
* Handling missing data effectively in datasets.
* Understanding feature importance in classification problems.
*Applying machine learning techniques to real-world data.
